# Event: LACTF
# Problem: PWN - gatekeep

## Approach
recon, develop, execute

### Programs required:
* Radare
* iPython3
* Python3
* pwntools

## Recon
First, we must recon the binary file and source code, if availible. 

There are a methods to perform recon:
1. Check security settings on the binary with the command: __checksec --file=[binary-file]__
2. View the **strings** in the provided binary with the command: __rabin2 -z [binary-file]__
3. View the **symbols** in the provided binary with the command: __rabin2 -s [binary-file]__
4. Examine the assembly code of the binary with Radare: __r2 -Ad [binary-file]__
5. If provided, examine the source code: cat [source-code-file]

## Develop

I use Python3, iPython3, and pwntools to craft my exploits.
